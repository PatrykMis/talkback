There is also an issue tracker where various issues and improvements can be discussed. Unfortunately, the upstream code is not being updated too often.

## How to Build

**NOTE:** This version won't build under Windows due to brltty incompatibilities. Patches are welcome. Use a GNU/Linux distribution, WSL2, or GitHub CI.

To build TalkBack, Issue the following command:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Don't forget to sign the release APK if you plan to use it.

## How to Install and run

1. Install the APK on your Android device using the standard adb method.
2. With the APK installed, the TalkBack FOSS service should now appear under Settings -> Accessibility. By default, it will be turned off. Toggle the switch preference to the "on" position to activate it.

Alternatively, you can enable TalkBack via ADB:

```bash
adb shell settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services app.talkbackfoss/com.google.android.marvin.talkback.TalkBackService
```

## Versioning

Versions follow the format "v$UPSTREAM_VERSION_WITH_BUILD_NUMBER-$RELEASE", where:

* $UPSTREAM is the public, visible version of upstream release.
* $RELEASE is a letter `f` followed by this fork's release number.

For example, "v12.1.0.397273158-f01" signifies the first release based on upstream version "12.1.0.397273158".
